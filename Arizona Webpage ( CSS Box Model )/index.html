            <h2 id="sec2Header"> Arizona Flag! </h2>
            <p id="sec2Body"> Arizona's state flag is divided into two halves. The top half consists of thirteen alternating red and yellow rays which represent America's thirteen original colonies. Because Arizona is a western state, the rays shows a setting sun. The colors of the rays refer to red and yellow in the Spanish flags carried by Coronado when he came to Arizona in 1540. The bottom half of the flag is a solid blue field, the same color as the blue in the United States flag. A large copper colored star is superimposed in the center of the flag. This identifies Arizona as the largest producer of copper in the United States. In 1910, Col Charles W. Harris designed a flag for the Arizona National Guard Rifle Team when they attended the National Matches at Camp Perry. Arizona was the only team in past matches without a flag. The Harris flag was adopted in 1917 by Arizona's Third Legislature and was passed into law without Governor Thomas Campbell's signature. <br>

            <h2 id="sec3Header"> The Grand Canyon! </h2>
            <p id="sec3Body"> The Grand Canyon touches four states: Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado. The most accessible and popular state to see the Grand Canyon is Arizona (South Rim) and Nevada (West Rim).
                South Rim will provide you with the classic national park experience with ranger talks, free hop-on-hop-off shuttles, and concessionaires. West Rim is run by the Hualapai Tribe. There is a per-person entrance fee that provides guests with a shuttle to the West Rim from the parking area. Guests may add on a Grand Canyon Skywalk ticket for additional purchase. A helicopter ride from Las Vegas is another popular way to get here. North Rim is the more remote side of the Canyon loved by hikers, backpacking campers and the like. You'll find the North Rim to be the least busy, but also the most difficult to access. The North Rim is closed October-May due to winter conditions.</p>
